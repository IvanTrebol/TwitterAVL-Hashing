Let me get this straight. 12 hours ago Dak was the man and MVP candidate. This morning we want Romo? Alright
I'm waking up and already seeing people calling for Romo to replace Dak. It's ONE game. It's their 1st loss since September. Make it stop!!
Let's be real for those blaming the QB. WRs were rarely open last night and the o-line was bad. Romo would have gotten hurt.#cowboynation
Dak keep playin like this romo be startin next year

@gmfb Tony Romo may be healthy by medical standards but he's too fragile to endure the QB sacks that Dak took from Giants! Would be crumbled

As adamant as Garrett and Jerry were after the game there's no way Romo is going in unless Dak gets hurt. https://t.co/OFN4br1wZ9

@landoup ?????? nigga want Romo back ???????????????
@KNegandhiESPN it's called perspective. It's not a back up. It's Tony Romo, and a rookie.
It's even worse when you live in DFW... and are a Chiefs fan. #ShootMeNow https://t.co/BSXeGPccRB

Are Cowboys fans really saying they should bench Prescott? Seriously? He had one bad game. How many time has romo thrown 4 picks
